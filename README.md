# foodstock-frontend

Foodstock is a web application that allows you to manage your food stock. It is composed of a frontend and a backend. This is the frontend part.

## Architecture
- A stock page that allows you to see all your food
- A list page that allows you to see all your lists
- a social page that allows you to give or get food for free with links to NGOs
- a profile page that allows you to see your profile and your settings

The frontend and backend are separated in two different repositories. The backend is available [here](https://github.com/food-stock/foodstock-frontend).

 I wanted them to be separated because I wanted to be able to change the frontend without changing the backend and vice versa.

 I chose to build a PWA and not a mobile app because I didn't wanted to be constrained by the app stores mainly.
